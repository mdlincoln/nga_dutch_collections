nga_dutch_collections
=====================

Scripts for visualizing the changing makeup of the Dutch paintings collections at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.

The Ruby scripts for scraping the NGA website require the `parallel` and `nokogiri` gems.

The R scripts for cleaning and plotting the data require `ggplot2`, `stringr`, and `dplyr`.
